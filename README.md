# Building a Restful API for Vending Machine with (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) APIs for User and Product Models with Node.js, Express and MongoDB #

Mongoose is an ODM (Object Document Mapping) tool for Node.js and MongoDB. It helps you convert the objects in your code to documents in the database and vice versa.  

## Prerequisites:  
Please install MongoDB in your machine if you have not done already. Checkout the official MogngoDB installation manual for any help with the installation.


### Vending Machine ###
Build a simple Vending Machine application. We will build Rest APIs for creating, listing, editing and deleting product and user models Also, allowing users with a “seller” role to add, update or remove products, while users with a “buyer” role can deposit coins into the machine and make purchases. The vending machine should only accept 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cent coins .  


Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start  Express.js app at `http://localhost:3000/`:

```bash
$ npm start
```
